This is a Social network in Django using PostgreSQL as the database! 

In thsi project you'll be able to find:
- CRUD
- Search
- User Login
- Flash Messages
- User Logout
- Restricted Pages
- User registration
- Chat Room Messages CRUD
- Activity Feed
- User Profile Page
- Static Files
- User uploaded content 
- Edit User Account Page
- Mobile Responsiveness
- Custom User Model Integration 
I used Function Based Views bcus in my opinion they let you unsderstand more of how things really work in the background in Django compared to CBV!

Go ahead and dive in, feel free to open up a profile and check the funtionality. Let me know of any suggestions to make it better! 

Enjoy!
